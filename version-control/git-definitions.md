# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows progress to be tracked. Version control lets you review code, go back to old code, and create backups of code. Version control is useful to go back and look at the history of a project or to revert to an older part of the project if a bug has been introduced. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a part of a project that does not dynamically impact the master branch. Branches allow for mulitple parts of a project to be built by one or more people at the same time. Branches help the master code to remain clean by having to be merged with the master which often happens through a pull request, review of code, and merge. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. This save point allows for the developer to go back to/ revert to that version of the code anytime they need. A good commit message describes what was added to the code that makes it different than the previously commited code. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two files changed the same thing and the master can't tell which file it is supposed to merge.
