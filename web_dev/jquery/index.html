		<h4>The Science of Happiness</h4>
		<p>The idea of gratitude is all the rage in women's and men's magazines, in health publications, and in international publications like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/choose-to-be-grateful-it-will-make-you-happier.html?_r=0" target="_blank">The New York Times.</a> Think all this "happiness stuff" is just some hippy dippie trend? It is a trend. A trend that has lasted thousands of years and originially started by Buddhist monks. The idea of actively focusing on activities that increase happiness just recently came into mainstream Western culture. Largely because science has now proved what the Buddhists have known for thousands of years...training your mind to be happy is like training to complete a marathon. If you have never run a marathon in your life when you start running you may run a bit but you get tired so you have to keep practicing to keep gain endurance. Same goes for our happiness. Sure we experience daily moments of happiness but we get distracted by things that happen everyday life...maybe someone you love is in a bad mood, maybe you get cut off on the freeway, etc. So in order to have our daily happiness last longer we have to actively engage in activities that will increase our "happiness endurance".</p>
