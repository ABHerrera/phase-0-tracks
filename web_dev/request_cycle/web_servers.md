<!-- 3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS? -->

<!-- A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine hosted in "the cloud" that runs its own copy of an operating such as Linux. The virtual machine is sold as a service by a company that specilizes in providing the software for small micro instances of data to sites and applications with millions of users. -->

<!-- 4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system? -->
<!-- It's a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system because it's the "super user" or main administrative user. It accesses everything on the operating systems and presents secruity threats when used on a daily basis.  -->
