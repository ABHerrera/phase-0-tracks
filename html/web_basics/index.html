	<title>Hotdogs for a Hungry World</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World! Are you hungry?</h1>
  <p>Here I am creating paragraph text. This is where information about really important stuff would go like the best hotdog recipe or who might be president of the United States. Lets say this page is about hotdog recipes (that's way more exciting then POTUS stuff).</p>

  <strong>The best hotdogs have the following basics:</strong><br>
  <em>(Note this is just a starting list of yummy things that make up the best hotdogs...the list is almost infinite.)</em>

  <ul>
    <li>a high-quality all meat hotdog or sausage</li>
    <li>a warm hotdog bun</li>
    <li>a sauce or two</li>
    <li>toppings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Topping are of particular importance. You can have the same base hotdog but totally take it in a different direction. For example, if you add kimchi and something tasty it becomes more of a Korean flared hotdog versus adding avocado to the top of your hotdog which can take it a fresh farmersmarket or Mexican flared route.</p>

  When I make a hotdog bar for friends I always have the following toppings available:

  <ol>
    <li>jalapenos</li>
    <li>mango</li>
    <li>peaches</li>
    <li>bacon</li>
    <li>cilantro</li>
    <li>onions</li>
    <li>kimchi</li>
    <li>chips (different flavors)</li>
    <li>some sort of green like arugula or kale</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I'll expand on the toppings based on the time of year but the list above is always a good foundation for a hotdog topping bar!</p>

  <p>Pinterest has great hotdog recipe ideas here's a board I started some time ago with ideas: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/adrianaherrera/perros-calientes/">Perros Calientes</a>. Happy eating!</p>
