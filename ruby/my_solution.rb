# EXPLANATION OF require_relative

require_relative 'state_date'
# Link between two documents, tells you where to get the information you need
# Difference between 'require_relative' and 'require'...'require_relative' is more of a direct path "where you can find the file" where 'require' telling interpreter what you want but not where to find it.

# Release 8: Reflect
# Difference between hast syntax in state_data file: one uses the hash rocket, one uses the symbol
# Link between two documents, tells you where to get the information you need
   # Difference between 'require_relative' and 'require'...'require_relative' is more of a direct path "where you can find the file" where 'require' telling interpreter what you want but not where to find it.
# A hash can be iterated though using different types of loops like a 'do' loop or a 'while' loop.
# When refactoring I saw that we really didn't need the variables in the method because the program could already read it.
# I most solified the loop structure and attr* methods (when we can use them)
