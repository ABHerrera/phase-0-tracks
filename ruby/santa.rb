#Update your Santa class with the following attributes:
# gender, which will be a string passed in on initialization
# ethnicity, which will be a string passed in on initialization
# reindeer_ranking, an array of reindeer from most preferred to least preferred. 
#   This is ruby not passed in on initialization; it simply gets a default value of ["Rudolph", "Dasher", "Dancer", "Prancer", "Vixen", "Comet", "Cupid", "Donner", "Blitzen"]
# age, which is not passed in on initialization and defaults to 0
