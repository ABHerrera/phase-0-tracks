# Create program that askes a designers client:
	# What is your name?
	# How many children do you have?
	# What style of beach decor do you prefer boho chic or sophisticated?"
	# "Is it true that sunlight is important to you? (Enter 'true' or 'false')"
	# "What is your budget?"
# Convert user input into appropriate data type
# Print the has back out the the screen when the user is done
# Give the user the opportunity to update the information
	# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). 
	# If the designer says "none", skip it. 
	# But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the key. 
		# (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) 
	# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.
