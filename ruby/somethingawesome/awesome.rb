# Write a Ruby program that uses persistent data to make your life better, 
   # or makes someone else's life better. Find several opportunities to try 
   # something not explicitly shown in the video. Can users create data? 
   # Retrieve it? Manipulate it? It's up to you. Push yourself, and decide with 
   # integrity when you are finished. Note that you do not need to use classes 
   # in this assignment -- keeping a class instance and a database row in sync is a 
   # lot of work, so that might be too much to tackle.
